# What is Queue?
# queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the 
# operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.


# We define a queue to be a list in which all additions to the list are made at one end, 
# and all deletions from the list are made at the other end.  The element which is first 
# pushed into the order, the operation is first performed on that.

# Characteristics of Queue:
# 1.Queue can handle multiple data.
# 2.We can access both ends.
# 3.They are fast and flexible. 

# Queue Basic operation := 
# 1. enqueue() ::: Adding Element
# 2. dequeue() ::: Removing Element
